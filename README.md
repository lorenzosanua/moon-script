# moon-script
Recoil script (cheats) for the game Rust. not usable as the input exploit is fixed.

Based on the logitech GHUB driver exploit (to send mouse move and mouse clicks).

A lot of work was done to get the sleep timers to be very accurate without hogging all the CPU, as even a single ms can throw off the recoil by a lot.

Cheating is cringe guys, this was done only to test my skills and learn new things.

I suggest you don't use any scripts/external programs to get an unfair advantage because you will notice very fast that it takes the fun out of the game, winning feels good only because you lose before you win.
